# Jacob Colburn's Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub Pages site! This is my personal portfolio where I showcase my projects, skills, and passion for technology and problem-solving.

## 🚀 About Me

Hi, I'm **Jacob Colburn**, a passionate developer with experience in Python, Java, MySQL, and web development. Growing up playing *The Legend of Zelda*, I developed a love for solving complex puzzles—whether in games or through code. Now, I channel that same passion into creating innovative and functional projects.

I thrive on the challenge of tackling problems through code and have worked on projects like:

- 🛠 **Employee Management System**  
- 📚 **Course Management System**  
- 🕹 **Pong** (classic game recreation)  
- 🔍 **Web Scraper**

I enjoy diving into new technologies to deepen my understanding of concepts like object-oriented programming, security, and more. With every project, I aim to level up my skills and create solutions that matter.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring stock trading, cryptocurrency, and crypto cards. As a fresh graduate, I’m always eager to learn, grow, and take on new challenges.
